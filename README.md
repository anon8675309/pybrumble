This is a hacked together Python implementation of the Briar specification.
Briar spec: https://code.briarproject.org/akwizgran/briar-spec

It should work anywhere, but it has only tested with Python on Linux.  Not
tested with legacy Python (Python2).

This package has not gone through any formal, independent testing for
compatibility nor security.  Use at your own risk.
